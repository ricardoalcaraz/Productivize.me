HELPFUL COMMANDS:

First time user pls install aws command line tools: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html

use AWS CONFIGURE and use secret keys and id's from the .env folder.

then use command:
`aws cognito-idp sign-up --region <region> --client-id <clientid> --username <name> --password <password> --user-attributes Name=email,Value=<dev_email>`
to make an admin user.

make the aws power folder:
with auth.json file inside with details:
```.json
{
  "UserPoolId": "<AWS_POOL_ID>",
  "ClientId": "<AWS_CLIENT_ID>",
  "AuthFlow": "ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH",
  "AuthParameters": {
    "USERNAME": "<username>",
    "PASSWORD": "<password>"
  }
}
```

you can now use
`aws cognito-idp admin-initiate-auth --region us-west-2 --cli-input-json file://auth.json`
from the .aws power folder.
- I also like to append `> response.json` to get results in a file.

this should result in the access tokens, refresh, and id tokens being granted to you.

i had to make sure app clients are configured to accept the API sign-in mode.


you can create an additional refresh.json file for refreshing by using the tokens you got earlier:
```
{
  "UserPoolId": "<AWS_POOL_ID>",
  "ClientId": "<AWS_CLIENT_ID>",
  "AuthFlow": "REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH",
  "AuthParameters": {
    "REFRESH_TOKEN": "<REFRESH_TOKEN>"
}
```

and use `aws cognito-idp admin-initiate-auth --region us-west-2 --cli-input-json file://refresh.json` to update your access token.

TODO: this should be simplified somehow.
