Miguel's 6 Microservice Mandates:

1. Server file should only contain middleware & startup logic.
2. api routes get their own module they should be ultra thin and crispy.
3. middleware and services should be in their own folders/modules.
4. databases will be behind a repository layer.
5. the repository layer will contain all of our business logic.
6. fuck it lmao.
